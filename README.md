### Installation

This code is written in Python 3.6 with PyTorch 1.0.0


### How to run

`Environment` This folder contains the maze environment used in the paper.

`Src` This folder contains the code for the proposed and baseline algorithms.

`Swarm` This folder contains the code for performing hyper-parameter sweep


For a single run of any algorithm:

 `Src/NS_parser.py` First set the desired hyper-parameters in this file.
 
 `Src/run_NS.py` After that execute this file.
 
 Note: You might need to appropriately set the root of your project for the import commands to work.
